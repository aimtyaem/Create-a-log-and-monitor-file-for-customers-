In this chapter, you will configure the development environment that you will use throughout the workshop. To have a consistent experience for all attendees, you will connect to a preconfigured EC2 Instance running Windows over RDP and configure IntelliJ as the IDE.


{{% notice info %}}
If you don't like Windows or IntelliJ and are tempted to use your laptop for the lab, **please don't**. You will produce more than 12 MB/sec into a Kinesis data stream; if you use your own laptop for that, the procedure will either fail, or break the conference network, or both.
